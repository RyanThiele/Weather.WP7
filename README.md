## Technologies Used
- MVVM Structure
- Dependancy Injection using AutoFac
- MessageBus (also known as an Event Aggragator)

This is a nastolgia project for the one of a kind hand device.

Note: Since Microsoft has completly abandonded the Windows Phone 7 era (I can't even gt a Windows Live ID), I have no choice but to abandon the project at this time. I have ported the project to [Weather.WP8](https://github.com/RyanThiele/Weather.WP7).
